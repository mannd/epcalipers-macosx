** You're on call, again...
It's 2 AM and the phone rings.  It's a nurse on the cardiac unit.  Mr. Smith is due to get his antiarrhythmic drug (who comes up with these crazy drug schedules?) and the ECG shows a borderline prolonged QTc interval, at least according to the computer.  She's not sure if it is safe to give the drug.  She wants to send you the ECG.

You drag yourself out of bed and open up your laptop.  There's the ECG in question.  You look at the QT interval.  Eyeballing it, the QT looks OK.  Mentally you start counting little boxes.  You pull out the (t)rusty old pair of mechanical calipers some drug rep gave you many years ago, when such largesse was still legal.  You think to yourself: I live in a digital age.  Am I really making measurements on a computer screen with a pair of mechanical calipers?
** Electronic calipers
*EP Calipers* provides *electronic calipers* for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your Mac.  The electronic calipers of *EP Calipers* are more accurate, easier to use, and less dangerous than mechanical calipers (they don't have sharp points!).
** Quick start
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG is loaded.  Click a caliper
icon on the toolbar to add a caliper to the screen.  Move the caliper
around by clicking on the caliper's crossbar and dragging it with the
mouse or your finger on the track pad.  Expand and contract the
caliper by dragging the bars on either end of the caliper.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG or use the zoom toolbar to enlarge or shrink
the image as needed.  If the ECG is bigger than your screen, you can
drag the image around with your mouse or finger, or use two finger
scrolling if you have a trackpad.  As an alternative to loading an
image you can make the main window transparent and use your electronic
calipers to measure any image that is open on your Desktop.  The rest
of these help pages will go over how to load ECG images, add and
delete calipers, calibrate the calipers and make advanced measurements
like the corrected QT interval.
** Toolbars
The program is controlled either by the toolbar buttons at the top of the window, or by the menu at the top of the screen.  The toolbars look like this:

Note that not all toolbar buttons will be available all the time, depending on whether calibration has been performed.  Some toolbar buttons are disabled when in transparent window mode also.  Disabled toolbar buttons are "grayed" out.

- *Back* Go back a step
- *Cancel* Cancel measurement
** Menus
Nearly all the functions of the app are contained in the main menu commands at the top of the screen.  Note that there are keyboard shortcuts shown in the menu for many of the programs's functions.  For example, it is easier to rotate an image using a keyboard shortcut key then a menu command.  As with toolbars, some menu commands are disabled when their use is not allowed.  For example, image rotation is not allowed after calipers have been calibrated.  It is necessary to clear calibration to restore the rotation menu commands.
