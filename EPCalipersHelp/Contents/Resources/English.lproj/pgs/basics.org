* [[../../shrd/64.png]] Introduction -- EP Calipers 101
** Electronic calipers
*EP Calipers* provides *electronic calipers* for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your Mac.  The electronic calipers of *EP Calipers* are more accurate, easier to use, and less dangerous than mechanical calipers (they don't have sharp points!).
** Quick start
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG is loaded.  Click a caliper
icon on the toolbar to add a caliper to the screen.  Move the caliper
around by clicking on the caliper's crossbar and dragging it with the
mouse or your finger on the track pad.  Expand and contract the
caliper by dragging the bars on either end of the caliper.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG or use the zoom toolbar to enlarge or shrink
the image as needed.  If the ECG is bigger than your screen, you can
drag the image around with your mouse or use two finger
scrolling if you have a trackpad.  As an alternative to loading an
image you can make the main window transparent and use your electronic
calipers to measure any image that is open on your Desktop.  The rest
of these help pages will go over how to load ECG images, add and
delete calipers, calibrate the calipers and make advanced measurements
like the corrected QT interval.
** Toolbar
The program is controlled either by the toolbar buttons at the top of the window, or by the menu at the top of the screen.  The default toolbar looks like this:

Note that not all toolbar buttons will be available all the time, depending on whether calibration has been performed.  Some toolbar buttons are disabled when in transparent window mode also.  Disabled toolbar buttons are "grayed" out.  You can customize the toolbar items if you wish.  On newer Macs some of the toolbar items are also shown on the Touch Bar.
*** Zoom toolbar
- [[../../shrd/TB_zoomIn.png]] Zoom in
- [[../../shrd/TB_zoomOut.png]] Zoom out
- [[../../shrd/TB_zoomActual.png]] Zoom to actual size
*** Calipers toolbar
- [[../../shrd/caliper-20x20.png]] Add time (horizontal) caliper
- [[../../shrd/amplitude-caliper-20x20.png]] Add amplitude (vertical) caliper
- [[../../shrd/angle-caliper-20x20.png]] Add angle caliper
- *Calibrate* Calibrate caliper
- *Clear* Clear all calibration
*** Measurement toolbar
- *Rate/Int* Toggle heart rate and time interval
- *mean RR* Calculate mean interval from several intervals
- *QTc* Measure corrected QT (QTc)
** Menus
Nearly all the functions of the app are contained in the main menu commands at the top of the screen.  Note that there are keyboard shortcuts shown in the menu for many of the programs's functions.  For example, it is easier to rotate an image using a keyboard shortcut key then a menu command.  As with toolbars, some menu commands are disabled when their use is not allowed.  For example, image rotation is not allowed after calipers have been calibrated.  It is necessary to clear calibration to restore the rotation menu commands.
