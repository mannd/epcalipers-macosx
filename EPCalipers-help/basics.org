* EP Calipers 101
** Rationale
*EP Calipers* provides electronic calipers for measuring intervals on images of electrocardiograms (ECGs) or electrophysiologic recordings.  In this age of electronic health records, ECG recordings are created electronically and transmitted digitally.  Even in cases where hardcopies are created (e.g. telemetry strips), it is common for doctors, nurses and medical technicians to take pictures of these recordings and send them to each other using smart phones and tablets.  In the past ECG measurements were made with a pair of calipers, an often inaccurate tool, especially given the typical slow recording speeds of standard ECGs (25 mm/sec).  Automated ECG interval measurements are helpful, though they too are often inaccurate.  I believe that the human eye is better at estimating the end of the T wave than a computer!  In the electrophysiology lab electronic calipers are included as part of the recording system.  *EP Calipers* is intended to provide similar electronic calipers for use on your Mac.  ECG zooming allows more accurate measurements than can be obtained with mechanical calipers.   And accurate measurements are important, as the risk of drug-related complications like Torsade de Pointes can be avoided by carefully following the QTc interval, for example.  *EP Calipers* makes such measurements very easy!
** It's intuitive
When *EP Calipers* starts, a sample ECG is loaded.  Click a caliper
icon on the toolbar to add a caliper to the screen.  Move the caliper
around by clicking on the caliper's cross-bar and dragging it with the
mouse or your finger on the track pad.  Expand and contract the
caliper by dragging the bars on either end of the caliper.  Pinch and
zoom the underlying ECG or use the zoom toolbar to enlarge or shrink
the image as needed.  If the ECG is bigger than your screen, you can
drag the image around with your mouse or finger.  The rest of these
help pages will go over how to load ECG images, add and delete
calipers, calibrate the calipers and make advanced measurements like
the corrected QT interval.
** Toolbars
The program is controlled either by the toolbar buttons at the top of the window, or by the menu at the top of the screen.  The toolbar looks like this:

Here are the toolbars.  Note that not all toolbars will be available all the time, depending on whether calibration has been performed.  Disabled toolbars are "grayed" out.
