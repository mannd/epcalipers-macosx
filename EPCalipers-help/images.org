* Loading an image
When you start *EP Calipers* a sample normal ECG is loaded.  To load your own ECG images, use the *File | Open* menu command.  You can also drag and drop an image file into the program window and it will load.  You can take a screenshot of a window (for example an ECG one your screen) using the *File | Screenshot* menu command, save it to your desktop, and then open it if drag it into the program window for analysis.
* Adjusting the image
** Moving the image
In order to move the image, the Grab cursor must be used.  Click the Cursor Toolbar to select the Grab cursor (the hand) if it is not already selected.  Hold down the left mouse button or click the trackpad to grab the ECG image.  Holding down the button or your finger on the trackpad, move the mouse or finger to move the image.  Note that if you grab over a caliper, the caliper will move instead of the ECG image.
** Rotation
If your ECG image is rotated or tilted, use the *View | Rotation* menu items to correct this.  You can rotate by 90° or 1° increments in either direction.  *Important* You should rotate your image before calibrating your calipers or making measurements.  Once an image has been calibrated, rotation will affect the accuracy of the calibration.  For this reason, you can only rotate an image before you calibrate.  If you need to rotate the image after calibration, you will need to clear calibration (using *Clear* on the Calibration Toolbar or the *Calipers | Clear* menu command) before you can rotate.
** Zooming
If you have a track pad, pinch to zoom works.  You can also use the Zoom Toolbar to zoom in and out, or to set the image to its actual size.  Zooming is also available in the *View* menu.  Note that Caliper calibration *does* adjust with zooming.  There is no need to recalibrate the calipers after zooming.
** Image Edit
Double clicking on the ECG image will open the Image Edit menu.  The menu has many options that can be used to alter the appearance of the ECG, such as changing its color or contrast.

* Saving an edited image
Use the *File | Screenshot* menu item to activate the Apple screencapture utility.  Click the camera icon on the EP Calipers window, or type ESC to cancel the screenshot.  The screenshot will pop up in a preview window, where it can be printed or moved to another directory for further editing.  Note that the screenshot function is also a good way to get ECGs from eBooks and PDF files into the program.  Grab a screenshot of the window, move it to your desktop using the Preview app, and then drag it into *EP Calipers*!
