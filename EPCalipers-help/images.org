Images include files in typical image formats such as JPG and PNG, as well as PDF files.  When you start *EP Calipers* a sample normal ECG is loaded.  To load your own ECG images use one of the following methods.
* Loading an image
** Open command
Use the *File | Open* or *File | Open Recent* menu commands to select an image stored on your computer.
** Drag and drop
You can drag and drop an image file onto the app window and it will load.
** Right click menu
Even when *EP Calipers* is not open, you can use the right click menu to open an image file.  The right click menu is opened either by right clicking on a file if you have a mouse, or using the left mouse button with the Control key held down, or, if you have a track pad, two-finger tapping on the trackpad.  After selecting *Open With* a list of apps will appear.  *EP Calipers* will be on the list of apps that can open the image.  Click it and the app will start with the loaded image.  This method is especially useful for opening email attachments.
* Adjusting the image
** Moving the image
If you have a track pad, you can move the image around using two finger scrolling.  You can also move the image using the Grab cursor.  [[./shrd/TB_move.png]]  Click the Cursor Toolbar to select the Grab cursor (the hand) if it is not already selected.  Hold down the left mouse button or click the trackpad to grab the ECG image.  Holding down the button or your finger on the trackpad, move the mouse or finger to move the image.  Note that if you grab over a caliper, the caliper will move instead of the ECG image.  If you change the cursor to the Lock cursor [[./shrd/lock-16.png]] then clicking and holding down the button or your finger will not move the image, but will move the calipers.  This is useful if you want to move the calipers without inadvertently moving the underlying image.  Note that even when using the Lock cursor, it is still possible to use trackpad gestures to move and zoom the underlying image.  
** Rotation
If your ECG image is rotated or tilted, use the *View | Rotation* menu commands to correct this.  You can rotate by 90° or 1° increments in either direction.  The keyboard shortcuts for rotation are useful.  *Important* You should rotate your image before calibrating your calipers or making measurements.  Once an image has been calibrated, rotation will affect the accuracy of the calibration.  For this reason, you can only rotate an image before you calibrate.  If you need to rotate the image after calibration, you will need to clear calibration (using *Clear* on the Calibration Toolbar or the *Calipers | Clear* menu command) before you can rotate.
** Zooming
If you have a track pad, pinch to zoom works.  You can also use the Zoom Toolbar to zoom in and out, or to set the image to its actual size.  Zooming is also available in the *View* menu.  Note that Caliper calibration *does* adjust with zooming.  There is no need to recalibrate the calipers after zooming.
** Image Edit
Double clicking on the ECG image will open the Image Edit menu.  The menu has many options that can be used to alter the appearance of the ECG, such as changing its color or contrast.

* Saving an edited image
Use the *File | Screenshot* menu item to activate the Apple screen capture utility.  Click the camera icon on the EP Calipers window, or type ESC to cancel the screenshot.  The screenshot will pop up in a preview window, where it can be printed or moved to another directory for further editing.  Note that the screenshot function is also a good way to get ECGs from eBooks and PDF files into the program.  Grab a screenshot of the window, move it to your desktop using the Preview app, and then drag it into *EP Calipers*!
