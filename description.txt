EP Calipers provides electronic calipers to measure intervals on images of ECGs or electrophysiologic recordings.  In today's practice of medicine, it is common for doctors, nurses and medical technicians to photograph and send ECGs to each other via email and messaging using smart phones and tablets.  As an example, a physician on-call may be asked to review the QT measurement on an ECG to determine whether or not it is safe to continue a QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drug.  It is more difficult to make measurements on these images than it is with ECG recordings made on paper.  EP Calipers can be used to make these measurements on your Mac and do these calculations, using electronic calipers similar to those in electrophysiologic recording systems.
