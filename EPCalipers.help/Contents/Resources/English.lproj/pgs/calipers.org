* Adding and deleting calipers
Calipers come in two flavors.  Calipers with a horizontal crossbar and vertical sidebars are used to make time measurements and are called "time calipers."  Calipers with a vertical crossbar and horizontal sidebars are used to make amplitude measurements and are called, you guessed it, "amplitude calipers."
** Add Calipers
Add calipers by clicking on either of the two caliper icons on the Calipers Toolbar, or use the *Caliper* menu to do this.

** Selecting Calipers
In order to make measurements or calibrate, it is necessary to "select" a single caliper when there are multiple calipers on the screen.  A single mouse click or single tap on any part of a caliper selects it.  A selected calipers is evident because it is a different color (by default red, but you can change this) than unselected calipers (by default blue).  Single-tapping or single-clicking a selected caliper will unselect it.  Only one caliper at a time can be selected.

** Deleting Calipers
Double-tap on the trackpad or double-click with a mouse on a caliper to delete it.  Note that after calibration, even if you delete all calibrated calipers, new calipers that are added will retain calibration.
* Moving calipers
** Moving
Calipers can be moved regardless of the cursor state.  Use the left mouse button or press and hold the trackpad with your finger over the crossbar area of a caliper.  Drag the mouse or your finger to move the caliper as a unit.  
** Stretching (opening and closing)
If the cursor is positioned over either of the left or right bars (or top or bottom bars for an amplitude caliper) clicking with the left mouse button or hold your finger down on the track pad and then dragging will just move the caliper bar you are over.  In this way you can widen or narrow the caliper interval.  Note that you cannot move both bars at the same time (say with a pinch movement).  When you move one caliper bar, the other one always stays fixed.

By combining movements of the crossbar and sidebars of a caliper, you can place it anywhere on the ECG image to make measurements.
